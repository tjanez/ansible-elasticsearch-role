# Remove --quiet option from the default ExecStart command to enable logging to
# systemd journal.

[Service]
# NOTE: systemd disallows starting a service with more than one ExecStart
# setting, hence making it impossible to over-ride the default ExecStart
# command. More information here:
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1121783.
# However, there is a well known work-around which is to first set ExecStart
# command to an empty value and then set it to the correct value. More
# information here:
